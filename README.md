What is the project?

It is a solving for a lecture task for Creating of Sine wave and giving the ability to the user to translate and rotate Sine wave or even moving the scene by camera.

How does someone develop, use, and test the code?

Use Right arrow for regenerating the Sine wave in it's initial state.

Use Left arrow for regenerating the Sine wave in it's initial state.

Use UP arrow for translating the Sine wave on Y-axis.

Use Down arrow for rotating the Sine wave around Y-axis.

Use Space Key for making the camera look at X-axis.
